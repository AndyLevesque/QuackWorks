Change Log:
- 2024-12-06 
    - Initial release
- 2024-12-08 
    - Renamed depth and width
    - Multiconnect On-Ramps off by default
    - Multiconnect On-Ramps at 1/2 grid intervals for more contact points
    - Rounding added to edges
- 2024-12-10
    - Hexagon panel option
-2024-12-11
    - Updated on-ramp logic to prevent on-ramps every slot when half offset is disabled
    - Updated (in mm) to (by mm) for clarity
-2024-12-13
    -Ability to override slot distance from edge
-2024-05-02
    - Added dropdown for Multiconnect vs. Threaded Snap connections
    - Added dropdown for openGrid vs Multiboard mounting surfaces
    - Created threaded snap matching threaded snap profile of Underware (but also a teardrop for vertical printing)
    - Added 'backer only' option
    - Added 'Force Back Thickness' option to override the default back thickness of 6.5mm or 3.6mm depending on mounting style
    - Allowed mm adjustements to the tength of a mm

Notes:
- Slot test fit - For a slot test fit, set the following parameters
    - Internal_Height = 0
    - Internal_Depth = 25
    - Internal_Width = 0
    - wallThickness = 0
